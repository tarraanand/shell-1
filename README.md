Actually I spoke to Mahendra (PO) and Nimish(SM) requesting for WFH for the next 3 months. They are fine if the management agress, They don't have any problem.

Actually my mother is not feeling well. She is mentally and physically suffering alot. I need to be with her. I can't leave my mother in my home town and come to Bangalore.... If I bring her to Bangalore, she will be alone and face a lot of depression.... In the last one year my family has been completely disturbed with the deaths of my father, uncle, Grand-father.

She also needs to undergo eye surgery in March and April. I can submit the medical bills, which can help to talk with the client.

If you want me to shift to Hyderabad and join Wipro or UBS office, I can join from next week. Becz i have some relatives in Hyderabad, I can move with my mother to Hyderabad.

After June, I can come to Bangalore as my sister will be shifting near to our house. So she can take care of my mother. 

Please try to understand my family conditions, i am only the support to my family (mentally, physically and economically)

Thank you for understanding

Regards
